# Full Entity Schema Reference

This document defines the complete schema for entities, edges, and sources. Use this for verification pipelines to ensure data quality and detect hallucinations.

**Ground truth**: The contribute forms (`src/contribute/*Form.tsx`) define field constraints. This document reflects those constraints.

| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------- |
| Notes (HTML) | `notes_html` | FREEFORM_TEXT (rich text) |

### Verification (DB only)

| Field              | DB Column            | Type  | Description                                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Field Verification | `field_verification` | JSONB | Per-field verification status from verify-all.js |

The `field_verification` column stores a JSON object with structured status for each field. **Every value must be an object, never a bare string.** (Legacy bare-string values like `"verified"` were migrated to `{"status": "verified"}` on 2026-05-11.)

#### Canonical format

Every field entry is an object with at minimum a `status` key:

```json
{
  "name": { "status": "verified" },
  "category": { "status": "unverified" },
  "belief_regulatory_stance": {
    "status": "verified",
    "confidence": "high",
    "verified_at": "2026-05-11T...",
    "source_url": "https://...",
    "corrected_from": "old value"
  }
}
```

**Status values:**

| Status               | Meaning                                               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `verified`           | Field value confirmed against external sources        |
| `unverified`         | Not yet checked or insufficient evidence              |
| `intentionally_null` | Entity field is NULL by design (see dual-track below) |
| `removed`            | Value was removed during correction                   |
| `inferred`           | Value derived from indirect evidence                  |

**Optional properties** (all types):

| Property         | Type                | When present                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `confidence`     | `high\|medium\|low` | After verification pipeline run           |
| `verified_at`    | ISO timestamp       | When last verified                        |
| `source_url`     | URL                 | Source that confirmed/corrected the value |
| `corrected_from` | string              | Previous value before correction          |

**Additional properties for `intentionally_null`:**

| Property               | Type                | Description                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `reason`               | string              | Why the field is intentionally null     |
| `inferred_value`       | string              | What the value would be if displayed    |
| `inferred_detail`      | string              | Longer explanation of inferred position |
| `inference_source`     | URL                 | Source for the inference                |
| `inference_confidence` | `high\|medium\|low` | Confidence in the inference             |
| `reviewed_at`          | ISO timestamp       | When reviewed                           |

#### Dual-track pattern: intentionally_null with inferred values

When an organization explicitly does not take official positions (e.g., METR, LawAI), the entity-level belief fields are set to NULL so the website UI shows no stance. However, inferred values from the org's publications are preserved in `field_verification` for internal use:

```json
{
  "belief_regulatory_stance": {
    "status": "intentionally_null",
    "reason": "Organization does not take official regulatory positions (per org comms May 2026)",
    "inferred_value": "Targeted",
    "inferred_detail": "Supports evaluation-based regulation with mandatory reporting...",
    "inference_confidence": "high",
    "inference_source": "https://metr.org/blog/2023-09-26-rsp/",
    "reviewed_at": "2026-05-11T..."
  }
}
```

This distinguishes three states:

- **Entity field has a value**: displayed on website, backed by claims
- **Entity field is NULL, field_verification missing or "unverified"**: not yet checked
- **Entity field is NULL, field_verification has "intentionally_null"**: org explicitly has no official position, but inferred value is preserved internally

The `claim` table still stores the underlying evidence with `claim_type: 'inferred_from_action'` (not `authored_position`), so the Sources & Claims panel can show what publications suggest without attributing an official stance.

### Manual review protection (DB only)

The `claim` table has:

| Field             | DB Column           | Type         | Description                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Manually Reviewed | `manually_reviewed` | BOOLEAN      | If true, automated scripts will not overwrite this claim |
| Reviewed By       | `reviewed_by`       | VARCHAR(100) | Who reviewed (e.g., 'anushree-manual-2026-05-11')        |
| Reviewed At       | `reviewed_at`       | TIMESTAMPTZ  | When reviewed                                            |

All automated upserts to the claim table must include `WHERE claim.manually_reviewed IS NOT TRUE` in the ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE clause. This prevents verification and enrichment scripts from overwriting human-corrected claims.

}

```

Status values: `verified`, `unverified`, `inferred`

### Beliefs

Organizations have limited belief fields in the contribute form:

**Note**: The org form only includes regulatory stance. Other belief fields (AGI timeline, AI risk, threat models) exist in the database but are not collected via the contribute form. Be careful about attributing beliefs to organizations - individual employee views do not equal organizational positions.

# Edge Fields

Edges represent relationships between entities. Direction matters.

## How Directionality Works

Every edge has a **source** and **target**. The edge type describes the relationship **from source's perspective**.

```

source_id → edge_type → target_id

```

**Example:** "Sam Altman works at OpenAI"

- `source_id`: Sam Altman (person)
- `target_id`: OpenAI (org)
- `edge_type`: `employer`

The frontend displays bidirectionally:

- Viewing Sam Altman: "Works at OpenAI"
- Viewing OpenAI: "Employs Sam Altman"

## Edge Table Schema

| `publisher` | Org    | Resource | Org published the resource   |

**Symmetric relationships:** For `collaborator`, `partner`, etc., create edges in **both directions**.
